  <h6>Air Pollution</h6>
<margin: 100px;> <p>Lets start with air pollution, ever since the first industrial factory opened, continuous smoke has been leaked into the atmosphere. These gases include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and other carcinogenic pollutants. Besides the obvious problems like air quality or visibility, when these gases mix with water in the troposphere, acid rain occurs. Acid rain dissolves nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, which effectively starves trees. Further adding onto the problem acid rain releases aluminum into the soil, making it very hard for trees to absorb water. 28% of our oxygen is produce by trees, please protect our trees!  </p> <margin>

  <h6>Water Pollution</h6>
  <p>Water Pollution is caused by the dumping of garbage in our lakes, rivers and beaches. This pollution doesn't just make it hazardous to swim in certain bodies of water, or even gross, it also effects the surrounding plants and animals. That goes for drinking water too. Polluted waters can harm sea animals, for example plastic can choke animals, or chemicals can kill fish and plants. Fish in these polluted waters can contain plastic in their meat, making it dangerous for consumption.</p>
 <br>
  <h6>Land Pollution</h6>
<p>Land pollution is so easy to do or prevent. For example, let's say you just finished a drink and you walk past a trash can, you throw the cup but you miss, rather than picking up the cup you walk away because you are busy. That ideology is one of the biggest reasons why pollution exists. When you have garbage throw it out!  </p>
