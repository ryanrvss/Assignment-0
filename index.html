  <h6>Air Pollution</h6>
<margin: 100px;> <p>Lets start with air pollution, ever since the first industrial factory opened, continuous smoke has been leaked into the atmosphere. These gases include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and other carcinogenic pollutants. Besides the obvious problems like air quality or visibility, when these gases mix with water in the troposphere, acid rain occurs. Acid rain dissolves nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, which effectively starves trees. Further adding onto the problem acid rain releases aluminum into the soil, making it very hard for trees to absorb water. 28% of our oxygen is produce by trees, please protect our trees!  </p> <margin>
